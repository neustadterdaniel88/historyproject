            <p class="lead">A not-widely studied subject, the Golden Age of Pornography had a monumental impact on society, politics, and cinema. Through social change, new cinematic techniques, and legislation, the topic is densely-packed with information ready for analysis. Athough the era eventually met its downfall, its influence remains in free speech laws and cases as well as a fundamental change in the public's view and openness towards sexuality.</p>

                <p class="mb-5">The “Blue Movie” played an important role in shifting the direction of movies that were to come within the “Golden Age of Porn.” Blue movie depicts sex “without passion, without tenderness, without love, without joy.” This was among the first films to have a wide theatrical release in the United States as previous films did not have the breadth of viewership. This change would never have come to pass were it not for movies like "Deep Throat." As stated by a journalist writing for the City on a Hill Press, “Deep Throat was the movie that changed everything,” she said. “It took mainstream appeal to a whole new level that not everyone was ready for … it gave birth to a whole new medium. In essence, Deep Throat was at the forefront of this new “porn-chic” movement. It was the first explicit movie to engross audiences with its character devlopement and plot. With these release and wide acceptance of these movies,“The industry was seeing a steady rise in the ’70s, but it was still an uphill battle” according to City on a Hill Press. For instance, Despite the rise in porn related film during the 70s, the Reagan administration was determined to put an end to it, saying ‘flower children’ made messy.”

                <p class="mb-5"> With new movies like “The Devil in Miss Jones” and “Score” the film industry began to enter into ”The Golden Age of Porn.”
In this Golden Age, obscene films altered censorship laws, allowing explicit-adult-films to gain screen time at theaters. Due to this rise, free speech laws began to enter the conversation.

                <p class="mb-5">Through the cases of Paris Adult Theatre v. Slaton and Miller v. California, the “Burger Court” developed a new definition of what is considered explicit through the social value test: “Burger offered a new definition of obscenity: To find that any particular work is “obscene,” a court must conclude that the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; that the work depicts or describes sexual conduct in a patently offensive manner; and that the work, taken as a whole, lacks “serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.” Through these cases, it was ruled that obscene films were essentially not protected by the first amendment: In the same year as Miller v. California (1973), another anti-obscenity case, the Supreme Court passed PAT v. Slaton where obsence adult films were not protected under the first Amendment. This shows how eventful the 1973 was in terms of setting precedent for future cases on the topic. 
 As a result of the above cases, many of the explicit movies of the time were subjected to legal scrutiny: Judge Ringel, one of the judges on the case of the Blue Movie, declared that the movie was a sin and did not pass the social reedemability test. Thus, either a fine or a jail sentence was due. Meaning, Judges rejected the Blue Movie as socially acceptable through precedent that established the need for explicit content to hold some social, educational, or political value.

                <p class="mb-5">The rise in sexually explicit cinema in the 70s led to a rise of sexually explicit advertisements on marquees, billboards, album covers, and newspapers, as well as a growing public approval. Congress Authorized LBJ to appoint a special blue-ribbon Commission on Obscenity and Pornography to find out  whether exposure to sexually explicit material caused “antisocial behavior.” The report found that the majority of people were exposed to such graphic materials, 70 percent before 18 years old, reported more positive effects than negative. In line with this, those defending this form of cinematic expression referred to this change in social acceptance as a defense for its explicit nature. For instance, one of the lawyers in defense of the acceptability of the Blue Movie stated that there had been a “dramatic change in social climate in the mass media” as evidenced in films like Easy Rider. While the legal system still held precedent, social perception of explicit material shifted, as shown through a larger reception for more explicit films.

                <p class="mb-5">After Reagan's inauguration, the redifining of conservatism led to a beat down of the adult industry. This led to a drop in the commercial value and social value of explicit adult films and art. Additionally, at the same time, video cassettes replaced cinema as the prefferred means of creating and watching porn. Of course, this led to the downfall of the Golden Age of Porn as the value of such material was no longer high value or "Golden." “Mass appeal of the porn industry essentially died on January 20, 1981, and it never really found any sort of major resurrection,” said Justin Hockyard. 
 This statement, in reference to Reagan’s inauguration, points to the redefinition of conservatism that led to a beat down of the adult industry which in turn led to a drop in the commercial value and social value of explicit adult films and art. Of course, this led to a growing level of legal efforts against such films: The NYC police sat in for a showing of “Blue Movie,” and arrested the theater manager; they also seized hold of film print which all points to the discepancy between the legal and social acceptance of explicit films during the late sixties and 70s. Eventually, pornographic cinema was supplanted by VHS, which led to the complete downfall of the Golden Age of Porn. Shifting cultural values, and the advent of new technologies, including VHS, DVD, cable television, and the Internet, simply overwhelmed the capacity of the law to constrain sexual expression. Pornogrophy in the form of VHS, in a way, brought on a level of social change that the films could not quite reach. It became such a popular and prolific form of pornography that it became immune to legal prosecution: “As the flood of sexual material outpaced the capacity of prosecutors to respond, community standards soon became more tolerant of what would once have been regarded as “patently offensive” depictions of sex, and the real-world definition of obscenity shrank down to a small fraction of what had once been thought to be obscene. And as the category of sexual expression that could satisfy even the new Miller standard narrowed, so that only the very hardest of what had once been thought to be hard-core pornography could warrant conviction, it became less sensible for government officials to expend scarce prosecutorial resources on what increasingly came to be seen as an essentially futile effort to suppress the market for such expression.”
